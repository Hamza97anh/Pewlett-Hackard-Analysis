## Purpose of the Project
By utlising SQL, the task is to determine the number of retiring employees in a large corporation. The employees were to be identified by title. The second task was to determine how many are eligible to particiapte in the mentroship program. This program require the employee to be of a certine age bracket which from the time of creating this data sheet is 1952 to 1955. SQL makes this possible as it's able to sift through large data sets such as the list of employees for large companies like Pewlett-Hackard. The end product should help the client better plan and anticipate the future when it comes to what positions to start reqruiting for.

## Conclusion
Seeing that a majority of the workforce is retirment eligable, the obvious right next move is to start highering new employees to fill the soon to be vacant postions. The main concern is having to replace that many employees in that short amount of time.Such a dramatic shift can have a great impact on the performance of the company, as many learning, assimilating, and team building hurdles will have to be overcome. One of the main reasons for this vulnarabilty is that Pewlett Hackard follows a more old school philosphy of work force managment. They enourges long term employees rather then a continous cycling of new faces in the workforce. While there is no conclusion to draw about why having either type is good or bad, it's safe to say that Pewlett Hackard will have a very difficult task that can lead to good results. Having a much younger workforce that's intune with the times can stimulate the companies growth in the coming years.
